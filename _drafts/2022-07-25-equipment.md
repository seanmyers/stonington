So we are eight or so weeks away and I know some of you are already thinking about what equipment we need to bring so I thought I would provide some basic information.

It will be later in the season so you should be prepared for highs in the 60's and lows in the 40s. That means bring several layers.

The basic list of equipment for each person is the following:
- one 20 liter wet bag to hold your clothes
- one 15 liter bag to hold misc things like share food (we probably only need three people to obtain these. I have one to use)
- one small bag (could be a baggie) to hold personal stuff
- one sleeping bag
- one air mattress
- a dish and utensils for meals
- wool hat for night
- rain jacket
- hat
- jackknife if you have one
- water bottle
- cup for hot and cold beverages
- water shoes or sneakers that can get wet
- dry pair of shoes for the camp

The common things we need are:
- two tents. I have one 3 man (2 comfortably). We could use another one of these plus possibly a bivvy sack for the 5th person
- two 5 gallon water containers. I have one
- stove. I have one
- cooking pot. I have one
- white gas (I can handle this)
- playing cards
- beer/booze (we will buy some beers in Stonington but you can only carry so much beer)
- first aid kit (I have a small one)
