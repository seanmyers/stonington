Last Wednesday morning (1/12/2022) my father William Myers passed away. I will miss him and always think of him.

Fifty-nine years ago today (1/18/1963) my father and my mother brought me into this world and raised me along with my four siblings. My mom told me that the day I was born she had to spend more time than expected in the delivery room. Back in the 60's men were not permitted in the delivery room, so as other fathers were ushered in to meet their new sons and daughters, my father had to wait patiently in a nearby room for me to arrive. Perhaps this was the defining moment of our relationship because while growing up and beyond, my father was always lovingly patient with me.

Coming to age in a suburb of Rochester, NY I would often push the edges of the envelope through various acts of childhood recklessness and ill-conceived adventures. My father, when made aware of these incidences, did not immediately get angry and yell. Instead he would patiently explain why what I did lacked good judgement and then with the requisite "grounding", we would move on.

When I changed my college major and needed to take five years to finish college and another several years of graduate school, he was patient with me and never questioned my choices. And even later in life, when I would change jobs or decide to start a business of my own, he would listen, be supportive, and respect my decisions.

I guess my father always had a sense of optimism which is why he was patient. Oh sure, he would sometimes get angry and make his displeasure known but most of the time it was his belief in me and his subtle encouragement to be better that resonates the most.

I remember the time when I was preparing to enter college and I did not have a clear idea of what my major should be. My dad bought me a book titled <ins>The Soul of a New Machine</ins>. Set in 1970's Boston, the book is about the competition to bring the best minicomputer to market first. I think he thought that studying computer science would be a good path for me and was using the book to subtly encourage me to make that my major. I did study computer science for several years (before changing it) and my whole career, including the businesses I have started, are oriented around computer technologies - perhaps because of his influence.

So at my Dad's passing I think a lot about our relationship and his affect on me and my siblings. I will remember him as a patient father who loved his children and held a caring belief that we would always do well no matter what mistakes we made along the way or the paths we chose.

Thank you Dad.

P.S. In case you missed it Dad, the Bills crushed the Patriots 47-17 in the Wild Card Playoff game on Saturday evening (1/15/22).
